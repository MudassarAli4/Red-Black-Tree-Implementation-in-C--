# Red-Black Tree Implementation in C++

This repository contains an implementation of a Red-Black Tree in C++, created as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) coursework. The Red-Black Tree is a balanced binary search tree that maintains its balance through specific properties and operations, ensuring efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.

## Features
- *Insertion*: Efficiently insert nodes while maintaining tree balance.
- *Deletion*: Remove nodes with rebalancing to preserve tree properties.
- *Traversal*: Implemented in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal methods.
- *Visualization*: (Optional) Includes a simple visualization of the tree structure.
