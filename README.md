# Red-Black-Tree-Implementation-in-C--
 This repository contains an implementation of a Red-Black Tree in C++, created as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) coursework. The Red-Black Tree is a balanced binary search tree that maintains its balance through specific properties and operations, ensuring efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.
